 [< Previous Challenge](./challenge07.md) - **[Home](README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./challenge09.md)

## Description

Deploy AKS in two regions and load balance the traffic for the deployed application. Deploy the application on both AKS clusters and select the right solution to balance the requests to the application.

## Success Criteria

2. Verify that the application responds appropriately regardless of which region the traffic is routed to.
